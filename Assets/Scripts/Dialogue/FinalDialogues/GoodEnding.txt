Hooded: Hi again, Scott Pilgrim.
Hooded: I want to present you your director, the Evil Dr. Fevens.
Evil Dr. Fevens: Congratulations, you defeated all my generals.
Evil Dr. Fevens: Good! It seems that through all your hardships, you were able to attain the A grade.
Evil Dr. Fevens: That's why I'll give you the legendary A+ Grade.
Evil Dr. Fevens: Also, I want to present you my associate on the left: The Good Dr. Fevens.
Good Dr. Fevens (previously Hooded): I am the Dr. Fevens from a parallel universe, one where I am not a director.
Evil Dr. Fevens: Our goal with you was to make you one of my general, the best there ever was.
Good Dr. Fevens: Scott, you have immense potential, but too little experience.
Evil Dr. Fevens: That's why we wanted you to defeat all my generals, so that you can become the one you really should be.
Good and Evil Dr. Fevens: Scott, you are now one of us.
