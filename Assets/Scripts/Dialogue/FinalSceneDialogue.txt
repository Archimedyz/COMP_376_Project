Hooded: Good Morning Scott Pilgrim, the F-Student.
Hooded: I see you are planning to withdraw from your program.
Hooded: That is toooooo bad. Such a great potential to waste...
Hooded: Before you do that, let me advise you.
Hooded: Your real enemy is not yourself. It is the director of our school, the Evil Dr. Fevens. 
Hooded: He is the one who stole your grade, the mighty A+ Grade, in order to control the student's mind.
Hooded: In order to confront the Evil Dr. Fevens, you will need to defeat his 5 generals.
Hooded: I wish you good luck on your way to the top.
