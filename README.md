<h3>Player Animation Log </h3>
I added a small script that moves the player around. Arrows to move. Daniel feel free to change it. Player run by default. The buttons written are just for testing.

	<li>Idle</li>

	<li>Defending (Button: Space)</li>
	<li>Jumping - Need a rigid body and gravity on to move up (Button: a)</li>
