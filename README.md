The aim of the project is to develop a game from scratch using the Unity Engine.
The Development period will be from Sept. 2015 to Dec. 2015.

<h3>Player Animation Log </h3>
I added a small script that moves the player around. Arrows to move. Daniel feel free to change it. Player run by default. The buttons written are just for testing.

<b>Colliders: Player have 2 colliders, each with its own script: one for getting hit, hitting boundaries, etc. The other one for fighting.</b>
 
<h6>Animations done (with collider)</h6>
<ul>
	<li>Running</li>
	<li>Idle</li>
	<li>Walking</li>
	<li>Defending (Button: Space)</li>
	<li>Jumping - Need a rigid body and gravity on to move up (Button: a)</li>
